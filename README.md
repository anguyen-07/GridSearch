# GridSearch
A Grid Search function that takes a list of supervised learning classifiers, data, and dictionary of hyperparameters to be tuned as input. The function returns the optimized classifier along with the hyperparameter value combinations that produces the highest accuracy score (or chosen performance metric). Plots are generated with matplotlib to visualize the performance of competing models and identify the optimal classification model with hyperparameter value combinations.
